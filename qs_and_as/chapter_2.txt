Chapter 2 - Mechanics of Futures Markets

2.1 Distinguish between the terms open interest and trading volume.

Volume is the number of contracts being exchanged. Open interest is the total
number of outstanding contacts.

2.2 What is the difference between a local and commission broker?

Commission brokers follow instructions from a client, whereas a local broker
executes trades on their own behalf.

2.3 Suppose that you enter into a short futures contract to sell July Silver
for $10.20 per ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange. The size of the
contract is 5,000 ounces. The initial margin is $4,000, and the maintenance
margin is $3,000. What change in the futures price will lead to a margin call?
What happens if you do not meet the margin call?

A future price of $10.40 will lead to a margin call. If you don't increase the
margin value back to the initial margin, the future position will be closed.

2.4 Suppose that in September 2009 a company takes a long position in a
contract on May 2010 crude oil futures. It closes out its position in March
2010. The futures price (per barrel) is $68.30 when it enters into the
contract, $70.50 when it closes out its position, and $69.10 at the end of
December 2009. Once contract is for the deliver of 1,000 barrels. What is the
company's total profit? When is it realized? How is it taxed if it is (a) a
hedger and (b) a speculator? Assume that the company has a December 31 year-end.

Total profit is 1,000 * (70.50-68.30) = 2,200
a) The full $2,200 is taxed in 2010.
b) In 2009: 1,000 * (69.10-68.30) = 800
In 2010: 1,000 * (70.50-69.10) = 1,400

2.5 What does a stop order to sell at $2 mean? When might it be used? What does
a limit order to sell at $2 mean? When might it be used?

A stop order means that when the stock price goes below $2 a market order is
placed to sell the stock. A limit order to sell means that the minimum price
the trader is willing to sell their stock is $2. This order is used when the
trader wishes to sell for a specific price or above.

2.6 What is the difference between the operation of the margin account
administered by a clearinghouse and those administered by a broker?

Clearinghouse has no maintenance margin.

2.7 What differences exist in the way prices are quoted in the foreign exchange
futures market, the foreign exchange spot market, and the foreign exchange
forward market?

All foreign exchange prices is quoted in USD, or as the number of USD per unit
of foreign currency.

2.8 The party with a short position in a futures contract sometimes has options
as to the precise asset that will be delivered, where delivery will takes
place, when deliver will take place, and so on. Do these options increase or
decrease the futures price? Explain your reasoning.

Beneficial to the part with the short position, therefore, reducing the options
price.

2.9 What are the most important aspects of the design of a new futures contract?

Asset, contract size, delivery arrangements, delivery months, price quotes,
price limits and position limits.

2.10 Explain how margins protect investors against the possibility of default.

Margins ensure that both parties have sufficient funds. If they can't honor the
margin then the future is closed.

2.11 A trader buys two July futures contracts on orange juice. Each contract is
for the delivery of 15,000 pounds. The current futures price is 160 cents per
pound, the initial margin is $6,000 per contract, and the maintenance margin
is $4,500 per contract. What price change would lead to a margin call? Under
what circumstance could $2,000 be withdrawn from the margin account?

A futures price less than 150 cents will trigger a margin call. A price
increase of 6 2/3 cents will trigger a withdrawal from the margin account.

2.12 Show that, if the futures price of a commodity is greater than the spot
price during the delivery period, then there is an arbitrage opportunity. Does
an arbitrage opportunity exist if the futures price is less than the spot
price? Explain your answer.

If the futures price is greater than the spot, sell the contract, buy at spot
price, and deliver asset at future price. Investor can enter a long call on a
future contract.

2.13 Explain the difference between a market-if-touched order and a stop order.

Stop sell order is to stop loss if the asset price is falling, stop buy order
is to stop loss if you are shorting and asset price is rising.
Market-if-touched order is a profit taker order if you are short and asset
price is falling.

2.14 Explain what a stop-limit order to sell at 20.30 with a limit of 20.10 means.

If the price of the asset falls to 20.30 or below, sell the asset, but for a
minimum price of 20.10.

2.15 At the end of one day a clearinghouse member is long 100 contracts, and
the settlement price is $50,000 per contract. The original margin is $2,000 per
contract. On the following day the member becomes responsible for clearing an
additional 20 long contracts, entered into at a price of $51,000 per contract.
The settlement price at the end of this day is $50,200. How much does the
member have to add to its margin account with the exchange clearinghouse?

Original margin requirement = 100 * $2,000 = $200,000
Additional margin for additional contracts = 20 * $2,000 = $40,000
Gain in original 100 contract value = 100 * $200 = $20,000
Loss in new 20 contract value = 20 * $800 = $16,000
40,000 - 20,000 + 16,000 = 36,000 need to be added to meet margin requirement

2.16 On July 1, 2009, a Japanese company enters into a forward contract to buy
$1 million on January 1, 2010. On September 1, 2009, it enters into a forward
contract to sell $1 million on January 1, 2010. Describe the profit or loss
the company will make in yen as a function of the forward exchange rates on
July 1, 2009, and September 1, 2009.

If July 1, 2009 forward exchange rate is more favorable than the September
1, 2009 forward exchange rate, the company will profit: 1,000,000 * (E2-E1).
If it is less favorable, they will lose 1,000,000 * (E1-E2). Keep in mind
forward FX rates for Yen will be quoted in Yen per USD.

2.17 The forward price of the Swiss franc for delivery in 45 days is quoted as
1.2500. The futures price for a contract that will be delivered in 45 days is
0.7980. Explain these two quotes. Which is more favorable for an investor
wanting to sell Swiss Francs?

Forward price is in Swiss Franc per USD. The futures price is in USD per Swiss
Franc. To compare them we can convert the forward price to USD per Swiss Franc
as 1/1.25 = 0.8. Therefore the forward price is more attractive to a investor
wanting to sell Swiss Francs.
