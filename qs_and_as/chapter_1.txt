1.2. Explain carefully the difference between hedging, speculation, and arbitrage.

Hedging reduces or eliminates risk. This can be accomplished using derivatives like options, forwards, or futures.
Speculation tries to obtain a profit by predicting the up or down movement of the market.

1.3. What is the difference between entering into a long forward contract when the forward price is $50 and taking a long position in a call option with a strike price of $50?

Long forward contracts are an obligation to purchase the underlying asset for $50 per unit on an agreed upon date. Long call options give you the right (but you are not obligated) to purchase the underlying asset for $50 per unit. Depending on the option type (European or American), you may be able to  exercise this option before the expiration date.
