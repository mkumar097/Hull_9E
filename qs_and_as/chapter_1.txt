Chapter 1 - Introduction

1.1. What is the difference between a long forward position and a short forward
position?

A short forward position is an obligation to provide the underlying asset on
the agreed upon date. A long forward position is obligation to purchase the
underlying asset on the agreed upon date.

1.2. Explain carefully the difference between hedging, speculation, and
arbitrage.

Hedging reduces or eliminates risk. This can be accomplished using derivatives
like options, forwards, or futures.
Speculation tries to obtain a profit by predicting the up or down movement of
the market.
Arbitrage identifies price discrepencies of the same product in two different
markets and exploits this discrepency to lock in a profit

1.3. What is the difference between entering into a long forward contract when
the forward price is $50 and taking a long position in a call option with a
strike price of $50?

Long forward contracts are an obligation to purchase the underlying asset for
$50 per unit on an agreed upon date. Long call options give you the right (but
you are not obligated) to purchase the underlying asset for $50 per unit.
Depending on the option type (European or American), you may exercise this
option before the expiration date.

1.4 Explain carefully the difference between selling a call option and buying a
put option.

When selling a call option, you are obligated to provide the buyer of the
option with 100 units of the underlying asset if they decide to exercise
the option. Purchasing a put option simply gives you the right (but
not obligation) to sell 100 units of the asset for the strike price.

1.5 An investor enters into a short forward contract to sell 100,000 British
pounds for US dollars at an exchange rate of 1.9000 US dollars per pound. How
much does the investor gain or lose if the exchange rate at the end of the
contract is (a) 1.8900 and (b) 1.9200?

a) 100,000 * (1.9-1.89) = 1,000
b) 100,000 * (1.9-1.92) = -2,000

1.6 A trader enters into a short cotton futures contract when the futures price
is 50 cents per pound. The contract is for the delivery of 50,000 pounds. How
much does the trader gain or lose if the cotton price at the end of the
contract is (a) 48.20 cents per pound and (b) 51.30 cents per pound?

a) 500,000 * (0.5-0.482) = 900
b) 500,000 * (0.5-0.513) = -650

1.7 Suppose that you write a put contract with a strike price of $40 and an
expiration date in 3 months. The current stock price is $41 and the contract is
on 100 shares. What have you committed yourself to? How much could you gain or
lose?

You are committed to buying 100 shares of the stock at a price of $40 per
share. Maximum profit is achieved if the option is never exercised and you get
to keep the option premium. Maximum loss is achieved if the stock price goes to
$0 and the option is exercised; you are then down $4,000.

1.8 What is the difference between the over-the-counter market and the
exchange-traded market? What are the big and offer quotes or a market maker in
the over-the-counter market?

Over-the-counter market trades are made between financial institutions, or
between a financial institution and their client. Terms of the trades made in
the over-the-counter market can be customized to whatever suits both parties.
Exchange traded market the contracts are standardized and the market
participants are unknown.

1.9 You would like to speculate on a rise in the price of a certain stock. The
current stock price is $29 and a 3-month call with a strike price of $30 costs
$2.90. You have $5,800 to invest. Identify two alternative investment
strategies, one in the stock and the other in an option on the stock. What are
the potential gains and losses from each?

Option 1: Invest $5,800 into the stock you can purchase 200 shares. Potential
gain/loss is 200 * (S2-S1) where S2 is the price of stock at a given time after
purchase and S1 is the price of stock at purchase.
Option 2: Invest $5,800 into 3-month call options with a strike of $30, you can
purchase 20 contracts. Potential gain is 2,000 * (S2-$30) if S2 > $30.
Potential loss is $5800 if S2 < $30 at expiration.

1.10 Suppose that you own 5,000 shares worth $25 each. How can put options be
used to provide you with insurance against a decline in the value of your
holding over the next 4 months?
