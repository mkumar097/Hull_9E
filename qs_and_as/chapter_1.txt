Chapter 1 - Introduction

1.1. What is the difference between a long forward position and a short forward
 position?

A short forward position is an obligation to provide the underlying asset on
the agreed upon date. A long forward position is obligation to purchase the
underlying asset on the agreed upon date.

1.2. Explain carefully the difference between hedging, speculation, and
arbitrage.

Hedging reduces or eliminates risk. This can be accomplished using derivatives
like options, forwards, or futures.
Speculation tries to obtain a profit by predicting the up or down movement of
the market.
Arbitrage identifies price discrepencies of the same product in two different
markets and exploits this discrepency to lock in a profit

1.3. What is the difference between entering into a long forward contract when
the forward price is $50 and taking a long position in a call option with a
strike price of $50?

Long forward contracts are an obligation to purchase the underlying asset for
$50 per unit on an agreed upon date. Long call options give you the right (but
you are not obligated) to purchase the underlying asset for $50 per unit.
Depending on the option type (European or American), you may exercise this
option before the expiration date.

1.4 Explain carefully the difference between selling a call option and buying a
 put option.

When selling a call option, you are obligated to provide the buyer of the
option with 100 units of the underlying asset if they decide to exercise
the option. Purchasing a put option simply gives you the right (but
not obligation) to sell 100 units of the asset for the strike price.

1.5 An investor enters into a short forward contract to sell 100,000 British
pounds for US dollars at an exchange rate of 1.9000 US dollars per pound. How
much does the investor gain or lose if the exchange rate at the end of the
contract is (a) 1.8900 and (b) 1.9200?

a) 100,000 * (1.9 - 1.89) = 1,000
b) 100,000 * (1.9 - 1.92) = -2,000

1.6 A trader enters into a short cotton futures contract when the futures price
 is 50 cents per pound. The contract is for the delivery of 50,000 pounds. How
 much does the trader gain or lose if the cotton price at the end of the
 contract is (a) 48.20 cents per pound and (b) 51.30 cents per pound?

a) 500,000 * (0.5 - 0.482) = 900
b) 500,000 * (0.5 - 0.513) = -650
