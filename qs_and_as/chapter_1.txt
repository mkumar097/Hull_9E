Chapter 1 - Introduction

1.1. What is the difference between a long forward position and a short forward
position?

A short forward position is an obligation to provide the underlying asset on
the agreed upon date. A long forward position is obligation to purchase the
underlying asset on the agreed upon date.

1.2. Explain carefully the difference between hedging, speculation, and
arbitrage.

Hedging reduces or eliminates risk. This can be accomplished using derivatives
like options, forwards, or futures.
Speculation tries to obtain a profit by predicting the up or down movement of
the market.
Arbitrage identifies price discrepancies of the same product in two different
markets and exploits this discrepancy to lock in a profit

1.3. What is the difference between entering into a long forward contract when
the forward price is $50 and taking a long position in a call option with a
strike price of $50?

Long forward contracts are an obligation to purchase the underlying asset for
$50 per unit on an agreed upon date. Long call options give you the right (but
you are not obligated) to purchase the underlying asset for $50 per unit.
Depending on the option type (European or American), you may exercise this
option before the expiration date.

1.4 Explain carefully the difference between selling a call option and buying a
put option.

When selling a call option, you are obligated to provide the buyer of the
option with 100 units of the underlying asset if they decide to exercise
the option. Purchasing a put option simply gives you the right (but
not obligation) to sell 100 units of the asset for the strike price.

1.5 An investor enters into a short forward contract to sell 100,000 British
pounds for US dollars at an exchange rate of 1.9000 US dollars per pound. How
much does the investor gain or lose if the exchange rate at the end of the
contract is (a) 1.8900 and (b) 1.9200?

a) 100,000 * (1.9-1.89) = 1,000
b) 100,000 * (1.9-1.92) = -2,000

1.6 A trader enters into a short cotton futures contract when the futures price
is 50 cents per pound. The contract is for the delivery of 50,000 pounds. How
much does the trader gain or lose if the cotton price at the end of the
contract is (a) 48.20 cents per pound and (b) 51.30 cents per pound?

a) 500,000 * (0.5-0.482) = 900
b) 500,000 * (0.5-0.513) = -650

1.7 Suppose that you write a put contract with a strike price of $40 and an
expiration date in 3 months. The current stock price is $41 and the contract is
on 100 shares. What have you committed yourself to? How much could you gain or
lose?

You are committed to buying 100 shares of the stock at a price of $40 per
share. Maximum profit is achieved if the option is never exercised and you get
to keep the option premium. Maximum loss is achieved if the stock price goes to
$0 and the option is exercised; you are then down $4,000.

1.8 What is the difference between the over-the-counter market and the
exchange-traded market? What are the big and offer quotes or a market maker in
the over-the-counter market?

Over-the-counter market trades are made between financial institutions, or
between a financial institution and their client. Terms of the trades made in
the over-the-counter market can be customized to whatever suits both parties.
Exchange traded market the contracts are standardized and the market
participants are unknown.

1.9 You would like to speculate on a rise in the price of a certain stock. The
current stock price is $29 and a 3-month call with a strike price of $30 costs
$2.90. You have $5,800 to invest. Identify two alternative investment
strategies, one in the stock and the other in an option on the stock. What are
the potential gains and losses from each?

Option 1: Invest $5,800 into the stock you can purchase 200 shares. Potential
gain/loss is 200 * (S2-S1) where S2 is the price of stock at a given time after
purchase and S1 is the price of stock at purchase.
Option 2: Invest $5,800 into 3-month call options with a strike of $30, you can
purchase 20 contracts. Potential gain is 2,000 * (S2-$30) if S2 > $30.
Potential loss is $5,800 if S2 < $30 at expiration.

1.10 Suppose that you own 5,000 shares worth $25 each. How can put options be
used to provide you with insurance against a decline in the value of your
holding over the next 4 months?

By purchasing 50 put contracts with a strike price of $25 and an expiration in
4 months, you gain the right to sell your 5,000 shares for $25 per share. This
means that even if the price of the stock drops, you are protected.

1.11 When first issued, a stock provides funds for a company. Is the same true
of a stock option? Discuss.

Stock options are agreements between parties and do not provide funds for the
company. When a company issues new stock they are selling a part of the company
to investors. Funds are generated with a stock issue.

1.12 Explain why a forward contract can be used for either speculation or
hedging.

An example of using a forward contract for speculation would be to enter a long
forward position to buy an asset at a certain price. If the market price of the
asset increases by the delivery date, you will be able to sell each unit of
the asset for a profit after the delivery. An example of using a forward
contract for hedging would be to enter a short forward position at a price,
and if the market price of that asset falls, you will be unaffected because you
have already agreed to sell the asset at a price without enduring a loss.

1.13 Suppose that a March call option to buy a share for $50 costs $2.50 and is
held until March. Under what circumstances will the holder of the option make a
profit? Under what circumstance will the option be exercised? Draw a diagram
illustrating how the profit from a long position in the option depends on the
stock price at maturity of the option.

The holder of the option will make a profit if the price of the stock is above
$52.50 on the expiration date in March. The option will be exercised only if
the stock price is above $50 on the expiration date.

1.14 Suppose that a June put option to sell a share for $60 costs $4 and is
held until June. Under what circumstances will the seller of the option
(i.e. the party with the short position) make a profit? Under what
circumstances will the option be exercised? Draw a diagram illustrating how the
profit from a short position in the option depends on the stock pricer at
maturity of the option.

Seller of the put option would make a profit if the market price of the share
on the expiration date in June is higher than $56. If the market price is
higher than $60 at expiration, the buyer of the put would not exercise the
option because they could sell the 100 shares in the market for a better price.
Seller of the put would keep the entire $400 option premium that was paid to
them. Option will be exercised if the market price of the stock is below $60 at
expiration.

1.15 It is May and a trader writes a September call option with a strike price
of $20. The stock price is $18 and the option price is $2. Describe the trader's
cash flows if the option is held until September and the stock price is $25 at
that time.

The trader receives $200 for writing the call. The trader will purchase 100
shares of the stock at $25 and then sell it at $20. This results in a loss of
$500 with a net loss of $300 after subtracting the initial cost of the call.

1.16 A trader writes a December put option with a strike price of $30. The price
of the option is $4. Under what circumstances does the make a gain?

The trader initially makes $400 for writing the put option. The premium begins
to disappear as soon as the stock price goes below $30. Once the stock price
goes below $26, the trader begins to lose money.

1.17 A company knows that it is due to receive a certain amount of a foreign
currency in 4 months. What type of option contract is appropriate for hedging?

Purchase a foreign exchange option or short a foreign exchange future.

1.18 A United States company expects to have to pay 1 million Canadian dollars
in 6 months. Explain how the exchange rate risk can be hedged using (a) a
forward contract and (b) an option.

a) Long a forward contract to purchase 1 million CAD in 6 months at a locked-in
exchange rate.
b) Buy a foreign exchange call option.

1.19 A trader enters into a short forward contract on 100 million yen. The
forward exchange rate is $0.0080 per yen. How much does the trader gain or lose
if the exchange rate at the end of the contract is (a) $0.0074 per yen and
(b) $0.0091 per yen?

Given the exchange rate, the trader will sell 100 million yen for 800,000
unknown currency
a) Trader profits $60,000 by entering into the forward contract.
b) Trader loses a potential $110,000 by entering into the contract.

1.20 The Chicago board of trade offers a futures contract on long-term Treasury
bonds. Characterize the traders likely to use this contract.

Prices of bonds are negatively correlated with interest rates. A trader who
thinks interest rates are going down may enter into a long futures contract on
long-term treasury bonds. A trader who thinks interest rates are going to go
up may enter into a short futures contract on long-term treasury bonds.

1.21 Options and futures are zero-sum games. What do you think is meant by this
statement?

If you make money on a futures contract, the party on the other side loses the
same amount of money. Same applies to options.

1.22 Describe the profit from the following portfolio: a long forward contract
on an asset and a long European put option on the asset with the same maturity
as the forward contract and a strike price that is equal to the forward price
of the asset at the time the portfolio is set up.

Long forward contracts are profitable if the asset price moves above the
forward price, but a long put will expire worthless. Long forward contracts
will result in a loss if the asset price moves below the forward price.

1.23 On July 1, 2008, a company enters into a forward contract to buy 10
million Japanese yen on January 1, 2009. On September 1, 2008, it enters
into a forward contract to sell 10 million Japanese yen on January 1, 2009.
Describe the payoff from this strategy.

The agreed upon exchange rate in the first forward contract is less than the
exchange rate in the second forward contract, the company has locked in a
profit of (10,000,000 * (E2-E1)).
