# Introduction to the Python Code

I have broken my Python code to reflect the three main derivative types that are
covered in Chapter 1 of Hull 9E: (1) forward contracts (2) future contracts (3) 
options. 

To demonstrate my ability to code using object-oriented programming (OOP), 
I have written class structures with methods that will calculate relevant 
properties using the first chapter of Hull as a guide.
