# Introduction to the Python Code

I have broken my Python code to reflect the three main derivative types that are
covered in Chapter 1 of Hull 9E: (1) forward contracts (2) future contracts (3) 
options. Functions presented in my code are a reflection of the different
types of calculations that are routinely in the examples provided in the text.

While the current version of the code is structured as basic Python functions, I can
incorporate object-oriented programming by introducing class structures. Currently, 
I am focused on making sure that all the basic functions are properly coded.
