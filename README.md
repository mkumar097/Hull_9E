# Options, Futures, And Other Derivatives (9th Edition)

As I work through the first three chapters of Hull 9E, I will add code written in
Python 3.8 that corresponds to some of the material that is covered. I will also 
add answers to end of the chapter questions as I work through them. Please be 
patient with updates to the code in this repository as I am currently finishing up
my PhD.

Any and all feedback is welcome, please feel free to email me with your comments!

Thank you,
*Manav Kumar*
