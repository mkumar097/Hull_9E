# Options, Futures, And Other Derivatives (9th Edition)

As I work through the first three chapters of Hull 9E, I will add code written in
Python 3.8 that corresponds to some of the material that is covered, all of my code
can be found in the `src` folder. I will also add answers to end of the chapter 
questions as I work through them, they can be found in the `qs_and_as` folder. 
Please be patient with updates to the code in this repository as I am currently 
finishing up my PhD.

Any and all feedback is welcome, please feel free to email me with your comments!

Thank you, \
